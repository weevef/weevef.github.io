In the summer of 2017 and 2018 I traveled to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic and participated in a Coding Summer Camp. The JPAL Poverty Action Lab based in MIT is a network of researchers that work on development economic projects. The founders Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee won the Nobel prize in economics this year actually! I worked on a project where researchers had identified the smartest 8th graders in the country of the Dominican Republic and invited a random group of 20 students to participate in a month long summer coding and robotics camp in Santo Domingo. I worked two summers in this project as a coding instructor and mentor to the kids in the program.

My main job was to lead sessions teaching basics of python in 2018 and in 2017 I taught them modules of scratch and basic programing for NXT robotics. We did several activities that I based on the work I had done in the past as part of a NXT robotics team in Connecticut since I was in 5th grade.  

The main challenge was that I was not provided a detailed guide of what to teach and I had to come up with material and propose it to my main supervisor. This was hard to do but it made me think much harder about what to cover and why it was going to be helpful for the students.
