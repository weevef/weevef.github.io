In this project a researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health asked me to help process data that was
acquired from the Federal Drug Administration. The data was posted online after the Washington Post
did a FOIA request to the DEA. The data comes in tables posted in PDF format and includes drug consumption for each controlled substance and is provided at the zip code level.

My job was to take the PDFs and turn them into a usable database. I implemented several data checks to
make sure I had not messed up like comparing the sum of the drug consumption at the zip an state level.
I made a few data visualizations for some medications I thought were cool.
