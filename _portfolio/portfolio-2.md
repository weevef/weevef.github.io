In the summer of 2019, I worked as a junior data scientist intern at an EdTech startup called ConsiliumBots. I worked for six weeks helping a team of data scientists process data from a spanish language Chatbot that was launched in Colombia earlier that year. My main job was to use python to do basic natural language processing procedures to clean and summarize the data of the conversations between the chatbot and students who in Colombia who had been chatting with the bot about their college application plans.

I mainly did two specific things during the summer. The first was that had to figure out what time of day the chatbot interactions where most successful in getting more interactions from kids. The second thing was to summarize the things that kids asked about that the bot did not understand and so the conversations ended.

The main challenge I faced was that the lead programmer for the bot did not plan the output data so the data produced was a mess. I spent a long time working on a script to process the output to make the data more useful for analysis by the rest of the team.
