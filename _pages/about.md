Welcome to my website. I am a senior at Cambridge Rindge and Latin and I live in Cambridge, MA.
I am originally from Santiago, Chile and I moved to the US with my parents twelve years ago.
I love to play rugby and doing data science projects. I strangely derive a lot of happiness cleaning data to make it useable for doing analysis and making cool graphs. I am learning as much as I can to do better data visualization and to help teach other kids like me how to
get into coding and doing data science.

Check out my portfolio and my Github to see what I have been up to, comments are always welcome because I am still learning.

See some cool graphs I have made below:
