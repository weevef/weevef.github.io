Welcome to my website. I am a senior at Cambridge Rindge and Latin and I live in Cambridge, MA.
I am originally from Chile and moved to the US with my parents ten years ago. I love to
rugby and data science and I strangely derive a lot of happiness cleaning data to make it useable. I am learning as much as I can to do better data visualization and to help teach other kids like me how to
get into coding and data science.

Check out my portfolio and my Github to see what I have been up to.
